While such engines as xetex and luatex can use native system fonts,
the installation base of pdftex is large enough to justify its
continuing support with new fonts.


This package provides support files for the Adobe Caslon font family
from Adobe.  According to the Fontname scheme, this corresponds to the
family pac.  We provide the necessary font files---everything but the
fonts.
